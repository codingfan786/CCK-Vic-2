By achieving a dominant position among the South Italian states, we can form the South Italy Federation.;x

eventdesc1337002;In the years leading up to $YEAR$, the Hanseatic League and the Polish republic have had a contentious relation due to the two's division of Poland. In $YEAR$ a treaty was proposed to settle the dispute through a peaceable population transfer of ethnic Germans and Poles, laying the groundwork for the development of modern international claims courts.\n§RIf we accept the German pops in Polish controlled Westprussen will be moved to Danzig and Tuchel, and the Polish pops there will move to Polish Westpreussen.

These overlapping cores will also be removed and we will both gain a small amount of prestige.;x
eventdesc1337001;The Holy Roman Empire has experienced multiple setbacks during and after the centralization it underwent in the previous century. The encroachment of the Hanseatic trade league, the increasing influence and independence of the Burgundian Circle, and the loss of northern Italy have made the sustainment of the Empire untenable. In $YEAR$, after the setback of further losses of territory to the Hansa and Burgundians, the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I under the advisement of the Secret State Conference declared the Holy Roman Empire dissolved and established a new United Kingdom from the crowns of Austria, Bohemia, and Bavaria.;x
