sif_form_desc;While Italy was not united until the proclamation of the Italian Union State, rising nationalism in the 19th century had meant that unification had been on the cards long before that, with the Naples assembly of 1848 being an important forerunner. By achieving a dominant position among the South Italian states, we can form the South Italy Federation.;x

eventdesc1337002;In the years leading up to $YEAR$, the Hanseatic League and the Polish republic have had a contentious relation due to the two's division of Poland. In $YEAR$ a treaty was proposed to settle the dispute through a peaceable population transfer of ethnic Germans and Poles, laying the groundwork for the development of modern international claims courts.\n§RIf we accept the German pops in Polish controlled Westprussen will be moved to Danzig and Tuchel, and the Polish pops there will move to Polish Westpreussen. In addition we will both lose cores on eachother's portion of Prussia.;x
treaty_of_prussia_title;Negotiate the Treaty of Prussia;x
treaty_of_prussia_desc; The division of Prussia in the previous century between the Hanseatic trade league and the Polish republic has left many ethnic Poles and Germans on the wrong sides of the border. We should negotiate a peaceable population transfer in order to put this conflict to rest. \n§RIf they accept we will exchange German and Polish pops in our overlapping cores in Prussia. These overlapping cores will also be removed and we will both gain a small amount of prestige.;x
eventdesc1337001;The Holy Roman Empire has experienced multiple setbacks during and after the centralization it underwent in the previous century. The encroachment of the Hanseatic trade league, the increasing influence and independence of the Burgundian Circle, and the loss of northern Italy have made the sustainment of the Empire untenable. In $YEAR$, after the setback of further losses of territory to the Hansa and Burgundians, the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I under the advisement of the Secret State Conference declared the Holy Roman Empire dissolved and established a new United Kingdom from the crowns of Austria, Bohemia, and Bavaria.;x

The cult has become so brazen as to attempt to coup the Chinese government and threatens to overrun all of Eurasia! \n§RSoon thousands of Confucian extremist rebel brigades will come pouring out of China towards Europe! The only way to stop them for good is to declare a special containment CB against China. Winning will stop the rebels and also give you and everyone who joined your war a large bonus to prestige, pop growth, immigration attraction, and infamy!;x
